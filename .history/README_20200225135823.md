# What is Object Oriented Programming? 

Object Oriented Programming is a programming concept, used to develop applications. 
It is a fairly simple concept, once you understand its **Four Principles**.

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Why is this important? 

Whenever you write code, you never want to do unneccesary work. Like when you write an essay, you want to avoid repeating yourself as much as possible. These Object Oriented coding principles saves you a lot of time, makes your program easier to read, and makes your program more efficient! 

#### *Lets explain why each principle is so important* 

### Encapsulation

When you make a class, it is very important to know what properties, fields, variables, or methods you will make public or private. Many times, you do not want other classes, or objects of a particular class, to change anything about the class you are working on. This is called *Encapsulation*. Think of Encapsulation as the sole protector of your precious classes.

Let's say we are making a game where you own a cat, named *Whiskers*. You play and feed Whiskers whenever you please. But, Whiskers is also his own person. He chooses when to eat, and meow. /n
In this case, we cannot let you, the player, have control over Whiskers' sleep, eat, and meow functionalities. But you do control if you feed, bathe, or play with Whiskers.
*Lets see how it looks*
