# What is Object Oriented Programming? 

Object Oriented Programming is a programming concept, used to develop applications. 
It is a fairly simple concept, once you understand its **Four Principles**.

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Why is this important? 

Whenever you write code, you never want to do unneccesary work. Like when you write an essay, you want to avoid repeating yourself as much as possible. These Object Oriented coding principles saves you a lot of time, makes your program easier to read, and makes your program more efficient!
